# Legit Legends

Have you ever seen those exciting mobile ads for a fun looking game, but when you actually download it, it's nothing like the video? This game is a fun little attempt to actually recreate a game that plays the same as those ads.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo

```console
git clone https://github.com/stumburs/legit-legends.git
```

2. Build the game

```console
make
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### Requirements
>
> - g++: Make sure you have g++ installed on your system. You can check if it's installed by running g++ --version in your terminal.
> - C++ Standard Library: The game depends on the standard C++ library, which should be bundled with g++ on most platforms.
> - C++20: The code (possibly) requires features from the C++20 standard (I just use it to avoid hassles). Make sure that your compiler supports it.
> - Make: You need make installed to use the provided Makefile. You can verify this by running make --version.

1. Run the game within `/bin`

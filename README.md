# Legit Legends

Have you ever seen those exciting mobile ads for a fun looking game, but when you actually download it, it's nothing like the video? This game is a fun little attempt to actually recreate a game that plays the same as those ads.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo

```console
git clone https://github.com/stumburs/legit-legends.git
```

2. Build the game

```console
make
```

3. Run the game within `/bin`
